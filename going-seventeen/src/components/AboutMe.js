    <p>Hi there! I’m Radiant</p>
        <p>
          I’m a Carat, OT13 biased, and currently a Computer Science major.
          I built this website as a little passion project to gather Seventeen
          content in one place (because let’s be honest—YouTube playlists can be
          chaotic TT).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have suggestions or ideas to make this site better, I’d love to
          hear from you! .
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope scrolling through this brings you as much joy as Seventeen’s
          endless chaos bring to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Made with love by Radiant (and powered by too much coffee and
          Seventeen playlists on repeat ofc).
        </p>
        <p>
        Missing my military line extra these days &lt;/3

        <p>Thanks for stopping by — byiiii</p>
